When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When colaborating with other people or want to make changes from diferent computers or save the files outside the computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up to date whit remote repository?

Not all the changes want to be pushed all the time
